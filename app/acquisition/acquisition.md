1. Freezing Processes

    Potential Issue: Freezing processes after memory capture could still allow some unintended changes if the system is not fully suspended. It’s essential to ensure that the freezing process halts all active processes completely.
    Improvement: Instead of just freezing processes, you might also consider pausing or suspending certain services, especially network services, to prevent external data updates during acquisition.

2. RAM Capture Tools

    Ensure that the method you use for RAM capture is forensic-sound. There are tools like Volatility or LiME (Linux Memory Extractor) that are designed for RAM extraction. These tools, when used correctly, should provide consistent results in an emulated environment.

3. Hashing

    Improvement: In addition to generating hashes of directories, you might consider generating a hash of the entire filesystem (if feasible), as it would give a complete snapshot of the device at a given time. For large directories, also consider hashing individual files to monitor changes more granularly.
    Use stronger hashing algorithms like SHA-256 instead of MD5 for better cryptographic assurance.

4. Logs and Timestamps

    Improvement: Capturing timestamps is essential, but you should also think about logging error conditions (e.g., if a process fails to freeze) and system resource usage during acquisition (e.g., CPU, memory). This would help verify that the acquisition process itself doesn’t unduly alter the state of the system.

5. Integrity of the Acquisition Process

    After acquisition, running a check to ensure that the acquired data matches the original hash (both on volatile and non-volatile data) would add an extra layer of verification to the forensic soundness of the process.
