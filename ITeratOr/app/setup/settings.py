"""
dev: The files in /dev are not actual data files but virtual interfaces created dynamically at runtime by the kernel. They do not persist between reboots and do not store static data.
proc: The contents of /proc are entirely dynamic and exist only while the device is running. Once the device is powered off or rebooted, the data is lost.
sys: Like /proc, the contents of /sys are generated dynamically by the kernel and do not persist across reboots.

"""
sdcard: This directory often holds evidence of user activity, making it critical for digital investigations.
/system/apex: Tampered or outdated APEX modules can indicate a compromised system or unauthorized firmware modification.
/etc/hosts: Modifications to this file can reveal attempts to redirect network traffic for malicious purposes.
/system/etc: Investigating system configuration files can reveal how the device is set up and identify signs of unauthorized changes.
/system/fonts: Modified or added fonts could indicate customization or tampering with the system (e.g., to inject malicious code in stylized texts).
/system/framework: Any tampering here could compromise the operating systemâ€™s behavior or indicate the presence of custom ROMs or malware.
/system/hidden: Hidden files can provide insight into device configurations, debugging attempts, or manufacturer-specific customizations.
/system/lib: Modified libraries could indicate the presence of exploits or tampered software.
/system/media: Changes to this directory can reveal user customization or tampering, such as replacing boot animations with malicious versions.
/system/priv-app: Unauthorized apps in this directory can pose significant risks since they run with elevated privileges.
/system/tts: Changes in TTS files could be a vector for malware or indicate system modifications.
/system/usr: Modifications here can indicate attempts to monitor or intercept user inputs, such as keylogging.
